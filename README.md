# Getting started with react app

Before starting you have to install React.js with a command npm install create-react-app

## Available Scripts

'npm start'
This command runs the app in the development mode.

'npm test'
This command launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

'npm run build'
Builds the app for production to the 'build' folder

'npm run eject'
If you aren't satisfied with the bild tool and configuration choices, you can 'eject' at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your 
project.


You will have to install React library which is a part of node.js framework to make this project working.
